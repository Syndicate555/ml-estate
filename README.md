## Project Inspiration:
In a saturated real-estate market, it has become increasingly difficult to make informed decisions about housing purchases from an investment perspective. To aid investors in taking advantage of the vast opportunities available in real-estate, our team has developed MLEstate This tool uses machine learning to more accurately determine areas where the real estate prices have the greatest potential for growth using historical housing price data from the past 25 years.

## What it does:
Using the Zillow API we collected data on housing prices over the last 25 years for every major US city and then used machine learning to perform a linear regression on each city's data to determine a line of best fit. Our model uses the slopes of the lines of best fit where a higher slope represents a higher rate of growth and vice versa. This processed data is reflected on our website using a heatmap where the places with the highest growth are indicated by the color red, and areas of least growth are marked by the color green.

## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
